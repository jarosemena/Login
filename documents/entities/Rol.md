### Role Entity Design for Active Directory Integration

#### Entity: Role

**Definition**: The  `Role`  entity represents a set of permissions that can be assigned to users within the application. This entity is designed to be compatible with Active Directory (AD) integrations, allowing for seamless synchronization of roles between the application and AD.

#### Attributes

- **id**: 
  - Type:  `int` 
  - Description: Unique identifier for the role.

- **name**: 
  - Type:  `string` 
  - Description: The name of the role (e.g., "Administrator", "User", "Manager"). This should match the role names defined in Active Directory for consistency.

- **description**: 
  - Type:  `string` 
  - Description: A brief description of the role's purpose and permissions.

- **permissions**: 
  - Type:  `list` 
  - Description: A list of permissions associated with the role (e.g., "create_user", "delete_user", "view_reports"). This can be mapped to the permissions in Active Directory.

- **active_directory_group**: 
  - Type:  `string` 
  - Description: The name of the Active Directory group associated with this role. This allows for integration and synchronization with AD groups.

- **created_at**: 
  - Type:  `datetime` 
  - Description: The date and time when the role was created.

- **updated_at**: 
  - Type:  `datetime` 
  - Description: The date and time when the role was last updated.

#### Relationships

- **User**: 
  - A  `Role`  can be assigned to multiple users.
  - A  `User`  can have one or more roles.

### Example of Role Entity in JSON Format

Here's an example of how the  `Role`  entity might be represented in JSON format:
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Administrator",
  "description": "Full access to all system features and settings.",
  "permissions": [
    "create_user",
    "delete_user",
    "view_reports",
    "manage_roles"
  ],
  "active_directory_group": "AD_Administrators",
  "created_at": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z"
}
### Integration with Active Directory

To ensure compatibility with Active Directory, the following considerations should be made:

1. **Role Synchronization**:
   - Implement a synchronization mechanism that periodically checks for changes in Active Directory groups and updates the roles in the application accordingly.

2. **Mapping Permissions**:
   - Define a mapping between application permissions and Active Directory permissions to ensure that users have the correct access based on their roles.

3. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**:
   - Utilize SSO capabilities to authenticate users against Active Directory, automatically assigning roles based on their AD group memberships.

4. **Role Management Interface**:
   - Provide an interface for administrators to manage roles, including creating, updating, and deleting roles, as well as assigning them to users.

### Conclusion

The  `Role`  entity design outlined above provides a robust framework for managing user roles within the application while ensuring compatibility with Active Directory. This design allows for efficient role management and seamless integration with existing enterprise systems. If you need further adjustments or additional details, feel free to ask!
